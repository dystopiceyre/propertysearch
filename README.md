# Property Search
Property Search is a website that allows people to view realestate listingg that have been posted by agents. This website doesn't only allow you to view listings, but it also allows you to post listings as an agent yourself if you selected the agent status during the registration.

# Getting Started
* To get started you should go to the "login" link in the nav bar, and then navigate yourself to the registration page by clicking on the register link under the "Login" button.

# What we're using
* Property Search is using the Fat-Free framework which also includes MVC (Model, View Controller)
* There is a model, view and control for every page that exists.

### We are also using:
* PDO
  * Including a database.php class, we are using functions which call prepared statements to add/insert, update and delete data into our PHPMyAdmin database.

* OOP
  * Using OOP we have built a total of 4 classes.
Some of these include the use of inheritance between their relationship with other classes.

# Validation
* We use PHP, Fat-Free and JavaScript help with server-side and client-side validation.

# Extra
* Our project follows PEAR standards and has every PHP and JavaScript function properly commented.

# Diagrams
* These diagrams are what we worked off of to create our classes and database relationships.
